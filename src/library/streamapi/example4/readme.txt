Create a method

Stream<String> streamSection(Stream<String> stream, int m, int n)

which extracts a substream from the input stream stream consisting of all elements from position m to position n, inclusive; you must use only Stream operations to do this.
You can assume 0 <= m <= n. A Java class has been provided for you in the lab folder for this lesson;
implement the method streamSection given in that class, and test using the main method provided.
