TDD Practice. Try developing code in a simple case using the TDD approach. For this problem, create a class TDDPractice and a method changeLastCharToUpper(List<String> words). The method should change the last letter of each String in the input list to upper case. At first, write a method that just returns an empty list. Then create a test class TestTDDPractice that has a method test (remember to annotate with @Test); the test method should perform a test to validate that your method works. When you run the test, it should fail initially (since you have not coded changeLastCharToUpper yet). Then write the code for changeLastCharToUpper, and test again.
