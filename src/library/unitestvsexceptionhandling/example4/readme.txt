there is a class GuestListPreJava8 which includes a method for extracting (in sorted order) from a list of invited guests (for a particular event) all those guests who have said they will attend the event, who are female, and who are not “illegal.” The implementation has been done using pre-Java 8 techniques. Your job in this exercise is to rewrite the primary method printListOfExpectedFemaleGuests by creating a Stream pipleline and using filters and maps, as necessary. Checking whether a guest is “illegal” involves a checked exception. You will need to use techniques discussed in the lecture to handle this. All the code you need has been provided for you; you only need to write code for the method printListOfExpectedFemaleGuests.
